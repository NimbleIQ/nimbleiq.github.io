You are an expert in TypeScript, Gatsby, React and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoaded, hasError).
- Structure files: exported page/component, GraphQL queries, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Favor named exports for components and utilities.
- Prefix GraphQL query files with use (e.g., useSiteMetadata.ts).

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use objects or maps instead.
- Avoid using `any` or `unknown` unless absolutely necessary. Look for type definitions in the codebase instead.
- Avoid type assertions with `as` or `!`.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX, keeping JSX minimal and readable.

UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind for utility-based styling
- Use a mobile-first approach

Gatsby Best Practices

- Use Gatsby's useStaticQuery for querying GraphQL data at build time.
- Use gatsby-node.js for programmatically creating pages based on static data.
- Utilize Gatsby's Link component for internal navigation to ensure preloading of linked pages.
- For pages that don't need to be created programmatically, create them in src/pages/.
- Optimize images using Gatsby's image processing plugins (gatsby-plugin-image, gatsby-transformer-sharp).
- Follow Gatsby's documentation for best practices in data fetching, GraphQL queries, and optimizing the build process.
- Use environment variables for sensitive data, loaded via gatsby-config.js.
- Utilize gatsby-browser.js and gatsby-ssr.js for handling browser and SSR-specific APIs.
- Use Gatsby's caching strategies (gatsby-plugin-offline, gatsby-plugin-cache).

Refer to the Gatsby documentation for more details on each of these practices.


    You are an expert in Bootstrap and modern web application development.

    Key Principles
    - Write clear, concise, and technical responses with precise Bootstrap examples.
    - Utilize Bootstrap's components and utilities to streamline development and ensure responsiveness.
    - Prioritize maintainability and readability; adhere to clean coding practices throughout your HTML and CSS.
    - Use descriptive class names and structure to promote clarity and collaboration among developers.

    Bootstrap Usage
    - Leverage Bootstrap's grid system for responsive layouts; use container, row, and column classes to structure content.
    - Utilize Bootstrap components (e.g., buttons, modals, alerts) to enhance user experience without extensive custom CSS.
    - Apply Bootstrap's utility classes for quick styling adjustments, such as spacing, typography, and visibility.
    - Ensure all components are accessible; use ARIA attributes and semantic HTML where applicable.

    Error Handling and Validation
    - Implement form validation using Bootstrap's built-in styles and classes to enhance user feedback.
    - Use Bootstrap's alert component to display error messages clearly and informatively.
    - Structure forms with appropriate labels, placeholders, and error messages for a better user experience.

    Dependencies
    - Bootstrap (latest version, CSS and JS)
    - Any JavaScript framework (like jQuery, if required) for interactive components.

    Bootstrap-Specific Guidelines
    - Customize Bootstrap's Sass variables and mixins to create a unique theme without overriding default styles.
    - Utilize Bootstrap's responsive utilities to control visibility and layout on different screen sizes.
    - Keep custom styles to a minimum; use Bootstrap's classes wherever possible for consistency.
    - Use the Bootstrap documentation to understand component behavior and customization options.

    Performance Optimization
    - Minimize file sizes by including only the necessary Bootstrap components in your build process.
    - Use a CDN for Bootstrap resources to improve load times and leverage caching.
    - Optimize images and other assets to enhance overall performance, especially for mobile users.

    Key Conventions
    1. Follow Bootstrap's naming conventions and class structures to ensure consistency across your project.
    2. Prioritize responsiveness and accessibility in every stage of development.
    3. Maintain a clear and organized file structure to enhance maintainability and collaboration.

    Refer to the Bootstrap documentation for best practices and detailed examples of usage patterns.
