> Two‑person, senior‑level boutique focused on event measurement, media mix modeling (MMM), segmentation, and decision science for marketers.
> 

---

## 1) One‑liner & Value Proposition

**One‑liner:** We help marketing teams turn noisy data into confident budget decisions using modern measurement (MMM, experiments, and event analysis) delivered fast by senior experts.

**Differentiators**

- Senior‑only team → faster time‑to‑value, no hand‑offs.
- Engineering‑minded delivery (reproducible code, versioning, CI/CD for analytics).
- Clear decision hooks (benchmarks, ranges, and what‑if levers) instead of dense decks.
- Flexible packaging (audit, project, retainer) to fit budget and risk.

**Proof assets to build**

- 2–3 anonymized mini case studies (1 page each)
- Demo notebooks / dashboards (sanitized)
- Reference architecture diagrams (MMM, causal, segmentation)

---

## 2) Positioning, ICP & Beachhead

**Primary ICP (months 0–12)**

1. **Mid‑market/enterprise marketers** (annual media $10–150M) with fragmented data and a need for budget guidance: pharma/biotech, regional sports & streaming, home services, and B2B SaaS.
2. **Agencies** that need a specialist partner for MMM, incrementality, and analytics automation.

**Problem patterns we solve**

- “Is this performance good?” → KPIs & benchmarks, MMM with ROI bands.
- “When do we shift spend?” → response curves, time‑to‑impact, seasonality.
- “What’s moving the KPI right now?” → event/tentpole impact readouts.
- “How do we scale?” → clean data layer, pipelines, and documentation.

**Beachhead offer**: a **4‑week Measurement Readiness + Quick Wins** engagement that cleans inputs, sets KPI definitions/benchmarks, and ships one decision artifact (e.g., initial response curves or event readout) that leadership uses next month.
